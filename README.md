# LightWritingAS3
Demo of a simple light writing technique. There isn't that much to it.  It should just run out of the box.

This project was setup using [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/), but should work okay with other IDEs.

Feel free to use however you like. I offer no warranties or support though.
